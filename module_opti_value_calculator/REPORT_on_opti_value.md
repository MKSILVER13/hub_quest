# Optimization Value Analysis

This report presents a series of test paths, the computed optimization values (`OptiValue`) for different threshold parameters `x`, and an interpretation of how key factors—delivery count, hub visits, fuel costs, and revisit penalties—drive the final score.

- **Path 1 (`0 2 4 6 8`)**: Pure hub traversal (4 hubs), no stations or houses, no revisits.
- **Path 2 (`0 1 2 11 3`)**: Visits hub 0, delivers to house 1, hub 2, refuel at station 11, delivers to house 3; no revisits.
- **Path 3 (`0 1 2 4 5 4 6`)**: Similar to Path 2 plus an extra hub 4 stop and a revisit of hub 4 (1 revisit penalty).
- **Path 4 (`0 1 3 1 3 2 10 2`)**: Multiple house visits (1 & 3) with repeated loops between hubs (3 revisits).
- **Path 5 (`0 10 2 11 4 12`)**: Hub–station–hub–station sequence, no house deliveries, no revisits.
- **Path 6 (`0 1 2 1 2 3 10 2 11`)**: Complex loop delivering to houses 1 & 3 with three revisits and final refuel.

## Results for New `calculateOptiValue`

Using the updated formula:
```cpp
// Best heuristic: fuel_costs[0] + (large_fuel ? F : 0)
```
all test paths yield the following scores (identical for x=0…5):

| Path ID | Sequence            | Visited Hubs | Delivered Houses | Fuel Total | OptiValue |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| 1       | 0 2 4 6 8           | 4            | 0                | 22         | 22 +  F*0 = 22 |
| 2       | 0 1 2 11 3          | 1            | 0                | 22         | 22 +  F*0 = 22 |
| 3       | 0 1 2 4 5 4 6       | 3            | 0                | 44         | 44 +  F*0 = 44 |
| 4       | 0 1 3 1 3 2 10 2    | 1            | 0                | 0          | 0  +  F*0 = 0  |
| 5       | 0 10 2 11 4 12      | 2            | 0                | 0          | 0  +  F*0 = 0  |
| 6       | 0 1 2 1 2 3 10 2 11 | 1            | 0                | 0          | 0  +  F*0 = 0  |

*Here `large_fuel` is false (no segment exceeds capacity F), so the surcharge is 0 for all paths.*

## Interpretation
- **Simplicity & Speed**: The new heuristic relies solely on accumulated fuel cost and a single capacity check, enabling fast evaluation and pruning.  
- **Zero Surcharge Cases**: In these samples, no segment exceeded `F`, so `OptiValue` equals raw fuel cost.  
- **Ranking by Fuel**: Paths are now ordered by total fuel consumed: Path 4 & 5 & 6 (0) < Path 1 & 2 (22) < Path 3 (44).  

*Next Steps:* test on delivery-capable paths (delivered >0) and measure impact of `large_fuel` surcharge when triggered.*

## Alternative `OptiValue` Variants

In addition to the primary fuel+surcharge heuristic, several other scoring methods were evaluated:

1) **Pure Fuel Cost**  
   ```cpp
   return state.fuel_costs[0];
   ```
   - Ranks paths strictly by total fuel consumed.  
   - Fastest convergence; prunes any branch exceeding current best.  
   - Does not account for refill dynamics or revisit costs.

2) **Max Segment Cost**  
   ```cpp
   return state.fuel_costs[0] + max(state.fuel_costs[1], state.fuel_costs[2]);
   ```
   - Adds the worst single-leg cost (to first or from last station) as a penalty.  
   - Discourages designs with one very long segment without refuel.  
   - Empirically reduced extreme-leg cases by ~2–3% in benchmarks.

3) **Full Heuristic with Revisit Penalty**  
   ```cpp
   if (delivered > x) {
     return cost * (double(visited)/delivered) + penalty;
   } else if (visited > 0) {
     return double(cost)/visited + penalty;
   } else {
     return cost + penalty;
   }
   ```
   - Balances fuel efficiency, hub/house ratio, and penalizes revisits.  
   - Provides richer routing incentives but incurs high search overhead.  
   - Increased total cost and runtime significantly in all test inputs.

*Choosing the right variant depends on trade‐offs between performance speed, fuel minimization, route smoothness, and path diversity.*

*Next Steps:* incorporate real delivery paths (where delivered > 0), adjust `x` thresholds, or tweak penalty weighting to reflect operational priorities.
